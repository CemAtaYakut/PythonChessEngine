# PythonChessEngine

## What is this?

This project was inspired by the idea of organizing a chess tournament at my school.  Since We run a tech-based university club, we decided to make it more exciting by creating our own chess engine and joining the tournament as a BOT. Fun, right? *(It's not cheating :D I change the scores, so AI can't find the best move)* so I come up with this: 

This engine is a fully functional chess engine that I built by applying countless hours of learning from the brilliant minds of Eddie Sharick and Sebastian Lague.

While many of the comments in the code are written in Turkish, the core structure is heavily influenced by Eddie Sharick's project as I followed his video series extensively. Itâ€™s a blend of learning, practice, and passion for coding.


## Setup Instructions

To run this chess engine project successfully, you will need the following installed on your system:

JDK (Java Development Kit) - Ensure that you have a JDK installed on your system. Compiler should suggest you to the direct download link.

Python and Pygame - Make sure Python is installed. Then, install the Pygame library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: *pip install pygame*


## How to play?

- Select whether you want to play against the computer, another player locally, or watch the engine play against itself by setting the appropriate flags in lines 52 and 53 of ChessMain.py.


*player_one = True  # if a human is playing white, then this will be True, else False*

*player_two = False  # if a hyman is playing white, then this will be True, else False*


- Run ChessMain.py. and enjoy.
- z is for undo a move
- r to reset the game


## Inspirations & Credits

Here is Eddie Sharick's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@eddiesharick6649
His detailed explanations and practical approach helped me understand and implement key chess engine concepts.  Huge thanks to Eddie for this massive upload to the internet.

Here is Sebastian Lague's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk
The idea for this project popped up my head after watching Sebastian's video. If you want to write in C#, deffinetly check his videos.
